# TuTok

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

To read the code first open lib.

There you can see the main.dart file, this file runs the whole app.

Then open src.

In the data folder, all parts are included to connect the backend to the App. 
First, you have the Models folder, there is every model defined that we use. 
Second the repositories there are the functions we need for connecting the functionality. 
Third, there are Services, there is API_Service which we need to provide authentication and the 
basic HTTP methods.

In the Tabs Folder, all frontend screens are included. The Main Folder gives you the main
layout for the app and the logic for the bottom navigation bar. The rest of the folders are 
self-explanatory and contain all a Readme.txt for finding which screen is shown after which.
